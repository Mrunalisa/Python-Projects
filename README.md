# Python-Projects
Hi everyone,

I'm excited to share some of the Python projects I've been working on recently:

Text to speech: I created a program that converts text input into speech output, using the win32com.client library. This can be useful for people with anyone who prefers to listen to information rather than read it.

Emoji to text: I built a tool that converts text that includes emojis into plain text, using the demoji library. This can be helpful when working with text data that includes emojis, such as social media posts or chat messages.

Weather application: I developed an app that provides current temperature and humidity information for a given city, using the API provided by weatherapi.com. This can be useful for anyone who needs to quickly check the weather in a particular location.

Face recognition attendance system: I designed a system that uses OpenCV and face recognition algorithms to recognize faces and record attendance automatically. This can save time for organizations that need to keep track of attendance for large groups of people.

PDF merger: I created a tool that merges multiple PDF files into a single document, using the PyPDF2 library. This can be helpful for anyone who needs to combine multiple PDF documents into one file.

Image resizer: I developed a program that resizes images to a specified width and height, using the cv2 library. This can be useful when working with images that need to be a specific size for a website or other application.

I'm always looking for new projects to work on and ways to improve my skills, so please feel free to reach out if you have any ideas or suggestions.

Thanks for reading!
